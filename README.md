# 🖼️ Steganography – Easy-to-Use Image Hiding Tool (Stego)

**Stego** is a smart and secure tool that lets you hide secret files inside images **without anyone noticing**.  
It combines **strong cryptography** with **AI-assisted steganography** to keep your data private, protected, and hard to detect.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### ✔ Strong Protection
Your hidden file is encrypted using **AES-256 + RSA**, the same standards used in banking and government systems.  
Only someone with the correct **private key** can extract the data.

### ✔ Compression
Files are compressed before hiding, reducing size and lowering detection risk.

### ✔ 🧠 AI-Assisted Adaptive LSB (NEW)
Stego uses **AI-based texture analysis** to intelligently choose **safe pixels** (edges and textured regions) for hiding data.  
This makes changes less noticeable and improves resistance to steganalysis.

### ✔ Smart Hiding Technique (LSB Steganography)
Hidden data is embedded using **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** modification, causing no visible change to the image.

### ✔ Preserves Filenames
Extracted files automatically retain their original filenames.

### ✔ Cross-Platform
Works on **Windows, macOS, and Linux** using Python.

## 🧠 AI-Assisted Adaptive LSB (How It Works)

Instead of hiding data in random pixels only, Stego now:

- Analyzes the image using **AI-based texture / variance analysis**
- Identifies **high-complexity regions** (edges, noisy areas)
- Embeds data **only in these safer pixels**
- Uses the same AI logic during extraction for perfect recovery

### 🔐 Why This Matters
- Changes are harder for the human eye to notice
- Statistical steganalysis becomes more difficult
- Security improves **without changing the encryption logic**

> This approach uses **classical AI / machine-learning principles** (feature extraction + decision logic), not heavy deep learning — making it fast, reliable, and exam-friendly.

## 📦 Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
🔑 Generate Encryption Keys
Create a public/private key pair:

python generate_keys.py
You’ll be asked to enter a strong passphrase.

This generates:

myprivatekey.pem → Keep this secret

mypublickey.pem → Safe to share

🚀 How to Use
1️⃣ Hide a File Inside an Image
python secret_pixel.py hide host.png secret.txt mypublickey.pem output.png
Parameters:

host.png – Cover image (PNG / BMP / TIFF recommended)

secret.txt – File to hide

mypublickey.pem – Public key for encryption

output.png – Image containing the hidden file

2️⃣ Extract a Hidden File
python secret_pixel.py extract output.png myprivatekey.pem [extracted.txt]
Parameters:

output.png – Image with hidden data

myprivatekey.pem – Private key for decryption

extracted.txt (optional) – Output filename
(If omitted, the original filename is restored)

🔐 Why Stego Is Secure & Hard to Detect
🔒 Military-Grade Encryption
AES-256 + RSA hybrid encryption protects data confidentiality.

🧠 AI-Driven Pixel Selection
AI selects visually complex regions, reducing detection risk.

🎯 Randomized & Adaptive Embedding
No predictable hiding pattern.

🖼️ Lossless Image Formats
Best used with PNG, BMP, TIFF, or TGA to preserve hidden data.

🛡️ Steganalysis Resistant
Difficult for tools like zsteg to detect hidden content.
